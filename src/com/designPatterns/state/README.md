<h1>STATE</h1>
<p>State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.</p>
<p>The main idea of State pattern is to allow the object for changing its behavior without changing its class. Also, by implementing it, the code should remain cleaner without many if/else statements.</p>
